#Plypeach Comics Style Generator

This project explores the use of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate images in the comics style of the artist Plypeach.
#Project Overview

The goal of this project is to generate new images in the style of Plypeach's comics using two different deep learning models: DDPM and DCGAN. To achieve this, we trained both models on a dataset of Plypeach's comics artwork, and used them to generate new images that resemble her style.

In addition to the image generation models, we also created a showcase website where users can browse through the generated images and learn more about the project.
